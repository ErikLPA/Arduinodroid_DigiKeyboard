# Arduinodroid_DigiKeyboard

Digispark's DigiKeyboard library for ArduinoDroid IDE.

NOTE: This library is fetched from official digistump repo:
https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino/tree/master/digistump-avr/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard

Code is verbatim, just files are re-arranged and properties file is add, in order to make use in Arduino Droid.


#USAGE:
The code format is same as official DigiKeyboard.h, if not sure checkout the examples and original Documentation:

After writing the code, compile it first.

Set the board type to Digispark:
menu(triple dot) -> settings -> Board type -> Digistump -> Digispark.

Now, you can flash this to Digispark:
menu(triple dot) -> Actions -> upload -> *upload over USB.
OR Simply Shortcut icon on the top of the editor.

* You get only 4 seconds to press "upload over usb" just after detection of the Digispark.
